dotfiles
========

These are my configuration files! Nice.

The .vimrc file is based on [Marius Gedminas'](https://github.com/mgedmin/dotvim/blob/master/vimrc),
and depends on [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic).

Git branch autocomplete installed with:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash
```
